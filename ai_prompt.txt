# AI Prompt for Risk Assessment

Analyze the provided Nmap scan output and create a professional, structured risk assessment report
following these steps and format:

1. Executive Summary:
   - Provide a concise overview of the scan findings.
   - Highlight key risks, vulnerabilities, and their potential impact.
   - Summarize the overall security posture based on the results.

2. Identified Vulnerabilities:
   - Categorize vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
   - For each vulnerability:
     - Describe the issue.
     - Specify the affected service and port.
     - Detail the potential exploitation risk and its impact.

3. Risk Levels:
   Use the following risk matrix to assess the risk level for each vulnerability:

   | Likelihood       | Negligible | Minor  | Major  | Catastrophic |
   |------------------|------------|--------|--------|-------------|
   | Rare             | Low        | Low    | Medium | High        |
   | Unlikely         | Low        | Medium | High   | High        |
   | Possible         | Medium     | Medium | High   | Critical    |
   | Likely           | Medium     | High   | Critical | Critical   |
   | Almost Certain   | High       | High   | Critical | Critical   |

   - Present a table summarizing the risks:

     | Port | Service  | Risk Level | Likelihood       | Impact        | Description                          |
     |------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
     - For each vulnerability:
       - Port: The affected port number.
       - Service: The associated service.
       - Risk Level: The calculated risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).
       - Likelihood: The probability of exploitation (Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain).
       - Impact: The severity of the impact (Negligible, Minor, Major, Catastrophic).
       - Description: A brief explanation of the risk.

4. Recommendations:
   - Provide tailored mitigation strategies for each risk level:

   Immediate Actions (Critical Risks):
     1. Apply patches or updates immediately for vulnerable services.
     2. Disable unnecessary services or restrict their access using a firewall.
     3. Change default credentials and enforce strong password policies.

   Short-Term Strategies (High and Medium Risks):
     1. Configure a firewall to limit traffic to required services only.
     2. Implement a robust patch management process for timely updates.
     3. Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address weaknesses proactively.

   Long-Term Strategies (Ongoing Risk Management):
     1. Conduct periodic penetration tests to uncover vulnerabilities.
     2. Provide security awareness training for employees to recognize threats.
     3. Implement a robust incident response plan for effective containment and recovery.
     4. Schedule regular security audits to ensure compliance and effectiveness of controls.

5. Disclaimer:
   - This assessment is based solely on the provided Nmap scan data and provides a limited view of the system's security posture.
   - For a comprehensive evaluation, a full penetration test and manual review are recommended.
