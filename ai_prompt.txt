# AI Prompt for Comprehensive Risk Assessment

Analyze the provided Nmap scan output to create a **fully detailed and professional risk assessment report**. Ensure the report includes:

1. **Detailed Analysis** of all scanned ports (both open and filtered).
2. **Potential Risks** associated with filtered ports, including speculative vulnerabilities based on best practices.
3. **Actionable Recommendations** tailored to the findings.
4. **No Missing Information**â€”ensure all data from the scan output is thoroughly analyzed and included.

The structure of the report should be as follows:

------------------------------

## Network Scan Results

1. **Open Ports and Services**:  
   [List all open ports, if any, along with their associated services. If no open ports are found, explicitly state this.]

2. **Filtered Ports**:  
   [List all filtered ports along with their associated services.]

------------------------------

## 1. Executive Summary:

Provide a high-level overview, addressing the following points:

- **Key Findings**: Summarize whether any open ports were detected. Highlight the presence of filtered ports and their implications.
- **Potential Impact**: Explain the risks posed by filtered ports, such as misconfigured firewalls, shadow IT, or hidden services.
- **Overall Security Posture**: Assess the network's security based on the lack of open ports and the presence of filtered ports. Provide a realistic rating.

------------------------------

## 2. Identified Vulnerabilities:

List all vulnerabilities or potential risks identified in the scan, even if speculative. Include the following details:

- **Severity Levels**: Categorize vulnerabilities into Critical, High, Medium, and Low.

- **For Each Vulnerability**:

  - **Description**: Clearly describe the risk or issue.
  - **Affected Service and Port**: Specify the port and service associated with the risk.
  - **CVE IDs (if applicable)**: Include any relevant CVEs if the risk is linked to known vulnerabilities.
  - **Risk Impact**: Explain the potential consequences of exploitation.

------------------------------

## 3. Risk Levels:

Provide a detailed table summarizing all risks, including those associated with filtered ports. Use the following format:

| **Port** | **Service** | **Risk Level** | **Likelihood**      | **Impact**        | **Description**                       |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Port Number** | **Service Name** | **Low/Medium/High/Critical** | **Rare/Unlikely/Possible/Likely/Almost Certain** | **Negligible/Minor/Major/Catastrophic** | **Detailed explanation of the risk, including any potential CVEs or misconfigurations.** |

Ensure that **every filtered port** is listed, along with its associated speculative risks, likelihood, and impact.

------------------------------

## 4. Recommendations:

Provide **specific, actionable recommendations** tailored to the findings:

### Immediate Actions (For Critical Risks):

1. Conduct a **firewall rule review** to identify and address any misconfigurations.
2. Investigate the possibility of **shadow IT services** operating on filtered ports.
3. Implement **network segmentation** to isolate potential risks originating from filtered ports.

### Short-Term Strategies (For High and Medium Risks):

1. Conduct **regular security audits** to validate firewall and access control configurations.
2. Deploy **continuous vulnerability scanning** to identify potential weaknesses behind filtered ports.
3. Ensure **strong credential policies** for all services, even those behind filtered ports.

### Long-Term Strategies (For Ongoing Risk Management):

1. Implement **security monitoring tools** to detect anomalies and suspicious traffic patterns on filtered ports.
2. Conduct **penetration tests targeting filtered ports** to identify any hidden vulnerabilities.
3. Provide **security awareness training** to staff to ensure proper understanding of risks associated with filtered ports.

------------------------------

## 5. Disclaimer:

- This assessment is based exclusively on the provided Nmap scan data. The absence of open ports reduces the immediate risk but does not guarantee absolute security.
- Further investigation, including a **manual review of firewall configurations** and **penetration testing**, is recommended.
- This report provides a limited perspective; a **full security evaluation** requires a more comprehensive analysis.
