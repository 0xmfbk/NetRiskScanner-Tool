Below is a detailed explanation of all its features and functionalities:\n\n---\n## 1. **Comprehensive Nmap Scanning**\n\nThe NetRiskScanner leverages the Nmap utility to perform advanced network scanning. It simplifies Nmap’s powerful functionalities through a graphical user interface (GUI).\n### **Supported Scan Types**:\n\n- **Ping Scan (`-sn`)**: Quickly checks whether hosts in a network are active without scanning ports.\n- **SYN Scan (`-sS`)**: Performs stealthy port scanning by sending SYN packets and analyzing responses. It does not complete the TCP handshake.\n- **TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`)**: Establishes full TCP connections to detect open ports, useful when SYN Scan isn’t available.\n- **UDP Scan (`-sU`)**: Detects open UDP ports by sending UDP packets and analyzing responses.\n- **Null Scan (`-sN`)**: Sends packets with no flags to detect closed ports.\n- **FIN Scan (`-sF`)**: Sends packets with only the FIN flag to detect closed ports.\n- **Xmas Scan (`-sX`)**: Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set to detect closed ports.\n- **ACK Scan (`-sA`)**: Maps firewall rules by sending ACK packets.\n- **Window Scan (`-sW`)**: Explores firewalls using TCP Window size.\n- **IP Protocol Scan (`-sO`)**: Identifies supported IP protocols on a target.\n### **Advanced Scanning Options**:\n\n- **OS Detection (`-O`)**: Identifies the operating system running on the target machine.\n- **Service Scan (`-sV`)**: Detects the versions of services running on open ports.\n- **Aggressive Scan (`-A`)**: Combines OS detection, service detection, and traceroute.\n- **Disable Ping (`-Pn`)**: Skips host discovery and scans all provided targets.\n- **Verbose Mode (`-v`)**: Provides detailed scan output in real-time.\n\nThese options are presented in dropdown menus and checkboxes, allowing users to customize scans easily.\n\n---\n## 2. **Real-Time Results Display**\n\n### **Dual Panel Design**:\n\n- **Left Panel**: Displays live scan results as they are received. This allows users to monitor scans in real-time without waiting for the entire process to complete.\n- **Right Panel**: Shows a detailed risk assessment based on the vulnerabilities identified during the scan.\n### **Progress Tracking**:\n\n- **Progress Bar**: Provides a visual representation of scan progress. It updates dynamically as the scan progresses, giving users real-time feedback on the operation's status.\n- **Status Bar**: Displays text-based status updates, such as “Scanning,” “Analysis Complete,” or error messages.\n\n---\n## 3. **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**\n\nThis feature uses **Google’s Generative AI** to analyze scan results and provide detailed risk assessments. The analysis includes:\n### **How It Works**:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**:\n   - Parses the Nmap output to identify open ports, running services, and their versions.\n   - Uses vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) to cross-reference findings.\n\n2. **Risk Levels**:\n   - Assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities (Low, Medium, High, Critical).\n   - Categorizes risks for each service and port.\n\n3. **Report Structure**:\n   - **Executive Summary**: Highlights critical risks and provides a summary of scan findings.\n   - **Identified Vulnerabilities**: Lists detailed descriptions of vulnerabilities and their impacts.\n   - **Risk Levels Table**: Organizes findings in a table format for clarity:\n     - Port\n     - Service\n     - Risk Level\n     - Description\n   - **Recommendations**:\n     - Immediate actions (e.g., applying patches, configuring firewalls).\n     - Short-term strategies (e.g., vulnerability scanning).\n     - Long-term strategies (e.g., penetration testing).\n\n4. **Dynamic Updates**:\n   - The Risk Assessment section is automatically updated when analysis is complete.\n\n---\n## 4. **Dynamic Button Management**\n\n### **State-Based Enable/Disable**:\n\n- **Analysis Button**: Disabled until a scan is completed.\n- **Save Button**: Disabled until the Risk Assessment section contains valid data.\n- **Clear Results Button**: Clears both scan results and risk assessments and disables dependent buttons.\n\nThis ensures that buttons are context-aware, reducing the chances of errors or unnecessary actions.\n\n---\n## 5. **Export and Save Options**\n\n### **Exporting Results**:\n\n- Users can save scan results and risk assessments to a `.txt` file for documentation and sharing.\n### **Saving Risk Assessments**:\n\n- Users can save the Risk Assessment report to a `.txt` file.\n- Includes a dialog box to specify file location and name.\n\n---\n## 6. **User-Friendly Command Display**\n\n### **Command Builder**:\n\n- Displays the exact Nmap command being executed based on user inputs.\n- Allows users to copy the command for use in a terminal or script.\n\n---\n## 7. **Error Handling and Validation**\n\n### **Input Validation**:\n\n- Ensures that target IPs, domains, and port ranges are correctly formatted.\n- Displays error messages if inputs are invalid.\n### **Runtime Error Handling**:\n\n- Catches unexpected errors during scanning or risk analysis and provides detailed error messages.\n\n---\n## 8. **Customizable Themes**\n\n### **Light and Dark Modes**\n\n- Offers two themes:\n  - **Cyborg** (Dark Mode): Ideal for low-light environments.\n  - **United** (Light Mode): Provides high visibility in bright settings.\n\n---\n## 9. **Core Functionalities Explained**\n\n### **Target Input Section**:\n\n- Accepts:\n  - Single IP or domain.\n  - IP ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.1-10`).\n  - CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).\n### **Scan Options Section**:\n\n- Dropdown menus and checkboxes simplify selecting scan types and advanced options.\n\n### **Split Display Section**\n- Results and risk assessments are displayed side-by-side for quick reference.\n- Scrollbars ensure all content is accessible.\n\n### **Clear Results Functionality**\n- Clears both panels and disables dependent buttons.\n- Resets the state of the application for a new scan.\n\n---\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nEnsure the following are installed and set up on your system:\n\n### **1.
